Complaint Details: 
To Whom It May Concern,

My name is [Name], and my social security number for tax purposes is [SSN_1]. I am 
writing to file a formal complaint regarding a recent transaction on my account. Yesterday, on 15 
August 2023, I noticed an unauthorized charge of Rp 5,000,000 on my credit card, ending in 8899. 
The full card number is [Card_Number].

This transaction was not made by me. My current bank account [Account]), should have a 
much higher balance. I suspect my data has been leaked. I was born on [DOB]. My 
driver's license number is [Plate].

Please investigate this matter immediately. You can reach me with this email. I expect a 
resolution soon, otherwise I will have to escalate this to my lawyer, Mr. [Name_2].

Sincerely, 
[Name]
