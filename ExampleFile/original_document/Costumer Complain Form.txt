Complaint Details: 
To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Budi Santoso, and my social security number for tax purposes is 987-65-4321. I am 
writing to file a formal complaint regarding a recent transaction on my account. Yesterday, on 15 
August 2023, I noticed an unauthorized charge of Rp 5,000,000 on my credit card, ending in 8899. 
The full card number is 4111-2222-3333-8899.

This transaction was not made by me. My current bank account (5566778899), should have a 
much higher balance. I suspect my data has been leaked. I was born on March 15, 1985. My 
driver's license number is D 1234 XYZ.

Please investigate this matter immediately. You can reach me with this email. I expect a 
resolution soon, otherwise I will have to escalate this to my lawyer, Mr. Andi Wijaya.

Sincerely, 
Budi Santoso
