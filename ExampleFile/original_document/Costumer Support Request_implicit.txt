Dear Support Team,

I’m currently reviewing my financial plans and would appreciate suggestions.

I’m planning to buy a car under 300 million IDR, and I’ve been setting aside part of my monthly income for the down payment and installments. I’m also saving around 4 million per month for a two-week trip to Europe next year, targeting a 50 million budget.

At the same time, I’m considering taking a professional certification soon. If there’s any product or feature that could help me manage savings, track goals, or automate payments, I’d love to hear more.

Thanks,
Septian
